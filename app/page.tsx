        a full-stack and cloud developer with a love for solving complex
        problems and building efficient, reliable systems. I thrive on creating
        solutions that work seamlessly and enjoy diving deep into the technical
        side of things. My approach is practical and detail-oriented, always
        focused on delivering results that matter.
        <br />
        <br />
        When it comes to web development, I specialize in building modern,
        scalable applications that get the job done. I enjoy working with
        frameworks like Next.js and leveraging tools like Prisma to create
        robust backends. For me, web development isn't about flashy designs-it's
        about functionality, performance, and creating systems that make life
        easier for users.
        <br />
        <br />
        On the cloud side, I'm passionate about designing and optimizing
        infrastructure. I've worked extensively with platforms like AWS and GCP,
        streamlining workflows and deploying scalable solutions. Whether it's
        automating processes, running containerized applications, or cutting
        operational costs, I'm always looking for ways to make systems more
        efficient.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm also a big fan of NixOS. Running it on my laptop and my VPS has
        taught me to configure, customize, and manage systems at a deep level.
        From managing packages to setting up advanced tools like Disko with
        Btrfs, NixOS has been central to my development journey.
